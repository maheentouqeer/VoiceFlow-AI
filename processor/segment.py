"""Split one continuous ramble into discrete, unrelated items.

A single ambient capture often contains several unrelated things said back
to back. AssemblyAI's own turn boundaries (pause-based) don't reliably line
up with *topic* boundaries, so this does a semantic re-segmentation pass
with an LLM instead of trusting pauses.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You split a transcript of someone rambling out loud into \
discrete, self-contained items. Each item is one thought: a bug, an idea, a \
reminder, a decision, a note - anything that could stand alone.

Rules:
- If the whole transcript is really just one thought, return one item.
- Split whenever the speaker clearly changes intent/topic. Common boundaries include:
  "Also", "Remind me", "We decided", "We have decided", "I think", "What if",
  "One more thing", or a new request after a completed sentence.
- Keep supporting sentences together with the thought they complete. For example,
  "Ali will handle the onboarding" + "flow that should require email verification"
  is ONE decision, not two items.
- A sentence such as "It's a bug" should stay with the immediately preceding
  problem when it clearly labels that problem as a bug.
- A reminder beginning with "Remind me..." is its own item even when it follows an idea.
- Do not merge a later decision, reminder, or idea into an earlier bug merely because
  both occur in the same paragraph or sentence stream.
- Don't invent content. Every item's text must be lifted from the transcript, \
  lightly cleaned up (remove filler words like "um" and false starts), never \
  rewritten or embellished.
- Preserve the original wording and meaning as closely as possible.
- CRITICAL: the transcript given to you is the ONLY source of content. Never \
  reuse or reproduce any wording from these instructions themselves - every \
  word in your output must come from what the speaker actually said.

Respond with ONLY a JSON array of strings, nothing else, matching this shape:
["<first distinct thought, in the speaker's own words>", "<second distinct thought, in the speaker's own words>"]
